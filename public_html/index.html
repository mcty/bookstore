							<b>Review(s):</b>
                            <p class="review">The Great Gatsby is a recognized 
							classic. Interestingly, the book did not sell very 
							well during Fitzgerald’s lifetime, and when he died
							in 1940 he seemed to have regarded the book as a 
							failure. When he died, scholars started to assess
							his work, and The Great Gatsby was recognized as 
							an important work of literature. Besides its recognition,
							one must also think about its meaning for us in the present
							day. The “prohibition” period that he writes about was a 
							strangely decadent period in America. Furthermore, the 
							catastrophes of the Holocaust and WWII changed much about
							the U.S. and its position in the world. Since then, too, 
							there has been substantial progress in civil rights, 
							including the rights of women. In this sense, his novel
							seems parochial, and not very relevant for us today: 
							Too much has changed about the world. Nevertheless, I
							think that if you approach the novel with an open mind
							and some knowledge of the historical context, you can 
							see elements that remain of interest today. Fitzgerald
							was struggling with themes that are larger than his times,
							and still speak to us today. In this sense, I can recommend
							this book.<br/>&emsp;--Michael George</p>
							<p class="review">I re-read TGG after more that 50 years 
							because my grandson is reading it as a set book at A-level.
							I didn't take in its supposed significance all those years 
							ago, and I don't now. Apparently it gained its early fame 
							because it was distributed to the US armed forces in huge 
							quantites during WWII. Those readers could probably appreciate
							the story of a young man from the wrong side of the tracks who
							had his emotional development held back by service overseas and
							coming into too much wealth. In 2018 the nearest equivalent
							is highly paid young footballers playing in forreign teams.
							It's a well constructed story told by a third person observer
							who maintains a necessary distance from the central emotional
							action. Readers have to do some work, and they should not be 
							too shocked at the anti-semitism of 70+ years ago, revealed 
							when we find out where the money came from. Why is it still 
							on exam syllabi? I'm not sure. Perhaps its a classic - one of
							the books that everyone knows they should read but . . .<br/>&emsp;--StephenDS</p>

							<b>Review(s):</b>
                            <p class="review">This story about a boy's search for
							his lost pet hamster has a ton to offer. The book
							includes lots of information about the solar system,
							presented in a fun and clever way. As the search goes on,
							the excitement builds with each new character.
							<br/>
							My six year old daughter enjoyed reading this rhyming
							tale to her brothers (with a little help) and they even
							spent the afternoon reenacting the story with stuffed animals,
							hopping from planet to planet.
							<br/>
							Highly recommended!<br/>&emsp;--Awdubreuil</p>
							<p class="review">This is a clever story about a boy in search 
							of his class pet through the solar system. In addition to a 
							quick lesson on the solar system, it includes concepts like 
							kindness, creativity, cooperation and determination. Both kids
							and parents will love this story!
							<br/>
							I have 4 and 6 year old boys and they both love the pictures 
							and the story; we've read it a few times already. My 6 year old
							is looking forward to when he can read the whole thing by himself.
							Both boys loved the rhymes (which also made it more fun for me to read)!
							They also have a love of the solar system and really enjoyed how the solar
							system was incorporated into the adventure. I have a few birthday parties 
							coming up and will definitely be ordering some as gifts.<br/>&emsp;--Jennifer DeCesare</p>

							<b>Review(s):</b>
                            <p class="review">Like The Little Prince and Bambi,
							this is a children’s story which adults will also enjoy.
							It’s the poignant but often funny tale of a clockwork 
							father and son who set out in search of the freedom to
							become self-winding. Along the way, they evade cunning 
							villain Manny Rat, make friends with creatures made of 
							both flesh and clockwork, and even watch an absurdist 
							play called The Last Visible Dog! Author Hoban is known
							mainly for his novel Riddley Walker and the Frances series
							of kids’ books, but this is a tale that no fantasy lover 
							should miss.<br/>&emsp;--T. Johnson</p>
							<p class="review">I'd only known the movie version of 
							The Mouse and His Child, so when I'd found out there was
							an actual book, I had to get it. I was rather surprised 
							at some of the things going on in the book. There were 
							times when I actually had to ask myself if it was indeed
							a children's book. There were some rather disturbing deaths
							that, while not exactly graphic, were still fairly detailed.
							The story flowed smoothly, in my opinion and I felt the 
							characters were more fleshed out than they ever were in 
							the movie. The Father and his son feared Manny the Rat 
							and you knew it! I think my favorite part was the ending
							where you saw what happened to all of the characters. I 
							also felt that while in the movie, the mouse and his child
							become "self-winding" in that they can move on their own, 
							in the book they become "self-winding" in that a motor inside
							of them just keeps them going. They can't stop and they can't
							move when they want to either. The "self-winding" concept was
							better in the book. There were also some rather cute sketches 
							throughout the story that helped keep the idea of it being a 
							children's book in mind. As a whole, I think this is a very 
							cute story but if you're looking for a book version of the movie,
							it will fall kind of short.<br/>&emsp;--H. Reed</p>

							<b>Review(s):</b>
                            <p class="review">This is one of the most well-put-together
							how-to books I've ever read. Kudos to Kevin Murphy for writing
							a book that covers it all in an easy-to-read, fun format. 
							I've been deep-sea fishing, but never fly fishing. Loved, 
							loved, loved the "Sam Tipper Says..." tips and tricks sprinkled
							throughout the book, as well as the little "fly hints" tucked 
							outside the margin on so many of the pages. If you're like me,
							you will first skim the book & read the Sams & the fly hints 
							and realize you've already learned an incredible amount before
							you even read the book. I wasn't overwhelmed or bored, and 
							gathered that I knew the basics (and then some) before I should
							go out on the river -- all with Sam Tipper guiding me along and
							putting a smile on my face.<br/>&emsp;--Jody G.</p>
							<p class="review">Kevin Murphy's Fly Fishing in Connecticut
							has to be one of the most unusual fly fishing books ever written.
							In an easy-to-read 100 pages, it teaches beginners everything they
							need to know about equipment, trout, hatcheries, streams, 
							weather, and more. It can be read in one or two nights and
							get an angler to the trout stream by Saturday morning. For
							such a small price, this book is worth its weight in gold!<br/>&emsp;--BillSpiJr</p>

                            <p class="review">This book, while lovely, did
							not meet my expectations. The farms mentioned
							are mostly located in the western half of the state.
							A great deal of the recipes were from restaurants in CT.
							There are more photos of chefs in this cookbook than there
							are for the recipes that are included. I almost feel 
							like this book is more of a marketing tool for the 
							restaurants and not about CT farms & recipes for their
							bounty. I would have like more pictures of the dishes 
							and less of the scenery.<br/>&emsp;--Jean Marie Haas</p>

							<b>Review(s):</b>
                            <p class="review">If you've ever played a sport 
							at a high level or wished to play a sport at a 
							high level, this will appeal to you. Jordan was 
							a baseball bonus baby - signed by the Braves 
							(then in Milwaukee) and sent to the minor leagues.
							Jordan's blazing fastball never translated into 
							success at the minor league level and after a couple
							of frustrating seasons, he walked away from the game
							with his new bride. He recounts with great detail 
							the boring hours spent on the road in small towns 
							killing time and waiting for games to start. 
							He recounts the frustration of not pitching 
							effectively. The book ends without a tidy wrap-up
							- he simply drives away from baseball and into his real life.
							<br/>
							Though I was never as talented or as sought after for my 
							talents as the author, my favorite section is how Jordan 
							recounts how he still likes to pitch, years after his career
							ended. But now he throws toward an unoccupied home plate in 
							front of no one at local recreational fields. He talks about
							the way it makes him feel and he's correct. How many times 
							have I done the same? With pitches, with free throws. In solitude.
							Too many times to count.
							<br/>
							A great book. Easily one of the top 20 baseball books I've ever read.<br/>&emsp;--clemente_in_right</p>
							<p class="review">Good insight into the author's time in minor 
							league baseball. Tedious in many places but a good read none-the-less.
							Honest writing by someone who went through it. Jordan writing skill shines
							through nicely. He is a fine wordsmith.<br/>&emsp;--Suttie Sutton</p>

                            <p class="review">I really enjoyed this book. Despite the somewhat dark material, 
							it was not a downer to read. It wasn't exactly uplifting, but the characters were
							unique and they were presented by a psychiatrist who offered a balanced view of 
							their humanity, both grotesque and and vulnerable. The short stories (I honestly
							don't know nor care which is a "novella") are a great way to tell these stories 
							from different perspectives.<br/>&emsp;--CJF</p>
							<p class="review">This book is for REAL! 
							It's not your typical or predictable "yawn"
							on convicted felons or death row inmates, so
							forget trying to determine how things will go.
							Goodwin's character development is as thrilling
							as it is disturbing. You'll be drawn into this 
							one for sure.<br/>&emsp;--CT Freeagent</p>

							<b>Review(s):</b>
                            <p class="review">This story about a boy's search for
							his lost pet hamster has a ton to offer. The book
							includes lots of information about the solar system,
							presented in a fun and clever way. As the search goes on,
							the excitement builds with each new character.
							<br/>
							My six year old daughter enjoyed reading this rhyming
							tale to her brothers (with a little help) and they even
							spent the afternoon reenacting the story with stuffed animals,
							hopping from planet to planet.
							<br/>
							Highly recommended!<br/>&emsp;--Awdubreuil</p>
							<p class="review">This is a clever story about a boy in search 
							of his class pet through the solar system. In addition to a 
							quick lesson on the solar system, it includes concepts like 
							kindness, creativity, cooperation and determination. Both kids
							and parents will love this story!
							<br/>
							I have 4 and 6 year old boys and they both love the pictures 
							and the story; we've read it a few times already. My 6 year old
							is looking forward to when he can read the whole thing by himself.
							Both boys loved the rhymes (which also made it more fun for me to read)!
							They also have a love of the solar system and really enjoyed how the solar
							system was incorporated into the adventure. I have a few birthday parties 
							coming up and will definitely be ordering some as gifts.<br/>&emsp;--Jennifer DeCesare</p>

							<b>Review(s):</b>
                            <p class="review">Like The Little Prince and Bambi,
							this is a children’s story which adults will also enjoy.
							It’s the poignant but often funny tale of a clockwork 
							father and son who set out in search of the freedom to
							become self-winding. Along the way, they evade cunning 
							villain Manny Rat, make friends with creatures made of 
							both flesh and clockwork, and even watch an absurdist 
							play called The Last Visible Dog! Author Hoban is known
							mainly for his novel Riddley Walker and the Frances series
							of kids’ books, but this is a tale that no fantasy lover 
							should miss.<br/>&emsp;--T. Johnson</p>
							<p class="review">I'd only known the movie version of 
							The Mouse and His Child, so when I'd found out there was
							an actual book, I had to get it. I was rather surprised 
							at some of the things going on in the book. There were 
							times when I actually had to ask myself if it was indeed
							a children's book. There were some rather disturbing deaths
							that, while not exactly graphic, were still fairly detailed.
							The story flowed smoothly, in my opinion and I felt the 
							characters were more fleshed out than they ever were in 
							the movie. The Father and his son feared Manny the Rat 
							and you knew it! I think my favorite part was the ending
							where you saw what happened to all of the characters. I 
							also felt that while in the movie, the mouse and his child
							become "self-winding" in that they can move on their own, 
							in the book they become "self-winding" in that a motor inside
							of them just keeps them going. They can't stop and they can't
							move when they want to either. The "self-winding" concept was
							better in the book. There were also some rather cute sketches 
							throughout the story that helped keep the idea of it being a 
							children's book in mind. As a whole, I think this is a very 
							cute story but if you're looking for a book version of the movie,
							it will fall kind of short.<br/>&emsp;--H. Reed</p>

							<b>Review(s):</b>
                            <p class="review">This is one of the most well-put-together
							how-to books I've ever read. Kudos to Kevin Murphy for writing
							a book that covers it all in an easy-to-read, fun format. 
							I've been deep-sea fishing, but never fly fishing. Loved, 
							loved, loved the "Sam Tipper Says..." tips and tricks sprinkled
							throughout the book, as well as the little "fly hints" tucked 
							outside the margin on so many of the pages. If you're like me,
							you will first skim the book & read the Sams & the fly hints 
							and realize you've already learned an incredible amount before
							you even read the book. I wasn't overwhelmed or bored, and 
							gathered that I knew the basics (and then some) before I should
							go out on the river -- all with Sam Tipper guiding me along and
							putting a smile on my face.<br/>&emsp;--Jody G.</p>
							<p class="review">Kevin Murphy's Fly Fishing in Connecticut
							has to be one of the most unusual fly fishing books ever written.
							In an easy-to-read 100 pages, it teaches beginners everything they
							need to know about equipment, trout, hatcheries, streams, 
							weather, and more. It can be read in one or two nights and
							get an angler to the trout stream by Saturday morning. For
							such a small price, this book is worth its weight in gold!<br/>&emsp;--BillSpiJr</p>

							not meet my expectations. The farms mentioned
							are mostly located in the western half of the state.
							A great deal of the recipes were from restaurants in CT.
							There are more photos of chefs in this cookbook than there
							are for the recipes that are included. I almost feel 
							like this book is more of a marketing tool for the 
							restaurants and not about CT farms & recipes for their
							bounty. I would have like more pictures of the dishes

							<b>Review(s):</b>
                            <p class="review">If you've ever played a sport 
							at a high level or wished to play a sport at a 
							high level, this will appeal to you. Jordan was 
							a baseball bonus baby - signed by the Braves 
							(then in Milwaukee) and sent to the minor leagues.
							Jordan's blazing fastball never translated into 
							success at the minor league level and after a couple
							of frustrating seasons, he walked away from the game
							with his new bride. He recounts with great detail 
							the boring hours spent on the road in small towns 
							killing time and waiting for games to start. 
							He recounts the frustration of not pitching 
							effectively. The book ends without a tidy wrap-up
							- he simply drives away from baseball and into his real life.
							<br/>
							Though I was never as talented or as sought after for my 
							talents as the author, my favorite section is how Jordan 
							recounts how he still likes to pitch, years after his career
							ended. But now he throws toward an unoccupied home plate in 
							front of no one at local recreational fields. He talks about
							the way it makes him feel and he's correct. How many times 
							have I done the same? With pitches, with free throws. In solitude.
							Too many times to count.
							<br/>
							A great book. Easily one of the top 20 baseball books I've ever read.<br/>&emsp;--clemente_in_right</p>
							<p class="review">Good insight into the author's time in minor 
							league baseball. Tedious in many places but a good read none-the-less.
							Honest writing by someone who went through it. Jordan writing skill shines
							through nicely. He is a fine wordsmith.<br/>&emsp;--Suttie Sutton</p>

							<b>Review(s):</b>
                            <p class="review">I really enjoyed this book. Despite the somewhat dark material, 
							it was not a downer to read. It wasn't exactly uplifting, but the characters were
							unique and they were presented by a psychiatrist who offered a balanced view of 
							their humanity, both grotesque and and vulnerable. The short stories (I honestly
							don't know nor care which is a "novella") are a great way to tell these stories 
							from different perspectives.<br/>&emsp;--CJF</p>
							<p class="review">This book is for REAL! 
							It's not your typical or predictable "yawn"
							on convicted felons or death row inmates, so
							forget trying to determine how things will go.
							Goodwin's character development is as thrilling
							as it is disturbing. You'll be drawn into this 
							one for sure.<br/>&emsp;--CT Freeagent</p>
